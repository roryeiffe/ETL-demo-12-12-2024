# ETL-demo-12-12-2024
Quick demo to go over design patterns, commit messages, best practices using ETL

## Requirements
- Have a csv file (can use existing one or create your own)
- Need some way to represent the data
- Need a way to read data from an external file
- Need code to convert the raw data to a Map/dictionary

## Best Practices to look out for:
- Committing often and including descriptive messages
- Commenting code with enough detail but not too much
  - At least have documentation for each method
- Employing the Single Responsibility Principal, making sure that a given class/module is only responsible for one thing

## Optional
- Logging
- Look into how this existing code can be improved (hint: thinking about design patterns)
